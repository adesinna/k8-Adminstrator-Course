There are times you might need to take down a node.

The time it takes a node to restart up is called pod-eviction-timeout which us 5 mins by default


If the pod is part of a replica set, if the node fails, it will schedule it on the other node to make sure its quota is fulfilled

When a node is not coming up, we can drain the node of its pods, so they can be created
on another node.

kubectl drain node_name # This will terminate all the pods, and recreate it on another and node pod will be scheduled on it when its comes back

Now when the node is rebooted, you can schedule pods on it

kubectl uncordon node_name # allowed it to be scheduled, by removing the restriction

kubectl cordon node_name # makes sure that pods are not scheduled on the node, but it does not terminate or remove existing pods on the node

kubectl get pods -o wide # to see the node these pods are


kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets # because it wont drain the daemonsets

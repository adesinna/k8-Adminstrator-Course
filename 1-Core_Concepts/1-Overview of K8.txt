The aim of kubernetes is to deliver you application in form of containers, it does these by using a master node and some
worker nodes.

Docker vs container-d:
    K8 was built to orchestrate docker containers, but as it grew in popularity, other containers also wanted to work
    k8. Now they built Container Runtime Interface(CRI) for every container runtime that comply with Open Container Initiative(OCI),
    but  CRI did not work with docker, since docker was built way before CRI. Container-d is what docker is built on and or any
    other container runtime is built on.
    Using crictl instead of docker in the commands will work for other container runtime.



ETCD:
    This is a distributed key-value store that is Simple, Secure and Fast.
    Every information you get about the objects in k8 are stored and gotten from the
    ETCD server. It stores information like python dictionary.




Kube-API Server:
    This is the primary manages the communication between CLI and cluster.


Kube-controller Manager:
    It monitors the state of the nodes and rectifies the problem.
        Node Controller:
            Checks the health of the nodes and reassign the pods to the healthy ones if the current node fails

        Replication Controller:
            Makes sure the replicate set is maintained.


Kube Scheduler:
    They decide which pod goes on which node based on some set of rules given by the nodes.

Kubelet:
    It listens for instruction from the kube-api, also reports back to it.

Kube-Proxy:
    This is the network of the worker node.

Container Runtime Engine:
    This is what deploys the container on the worker node, the kubelet instructs it.

Docker Storage:
    i. Storage Drivers
    ii. Volume Drivers


How do docker store data:
    When you install docker, it creates a folder /var/lib/docker
    It stores all files, like aufs, containers, image, volumes.

    When docker creates a container, it add its on the read-write layer of the build, which
    gets deleted when the container gets deleted. But if you want to persist the data

    docker volume create data_volume

    docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql

    Bind mounting is when the persistent data is in another location

    docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql

    Storages drivers are used to do all this mounting of images and containers



Storage Driver vs Volume Drivers:
    They help manages storage on images and containers, volumes are managed by volume driver plugins


Container Storage Interface:
    These are drivers that can be integrated with k8s, so you can have your own storage.

All communications in the cluster must be secured.

Server Certificates for Servers:

- Kube-api server:
   Since everyone tries to access it, it acts as a major server for many components.

    apiserver.crt & apiserver.key

- ETCD server:
    Since the kubeapi server needs to access it for data information, it acts as a server for it.

    ectdserver.crt & ectdserver.key

- Kubelet server
    Since it needs to receive data from the kube-api, to carry out operations on the worker nodes.

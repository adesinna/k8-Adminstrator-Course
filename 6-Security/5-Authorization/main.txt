This is what a user can do in the cluster.

Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

We create a role using the role.yaml

Next we create a role binding object, to connect the user to the role

kubectl get roles

kubectl describe role role_name

kubectl get rolebindings

kubectl describe rolebindings rolebinding_name


# to know whether you can do something

kubectl auth can-i create pods

If admin wants to check for other

kubectl auth can-i create pods --as dev-user



Cluster roles and rolebindings

Cluster scope resources are the one you do not specific name space when you create them.
More examples are nodes, certificatesiginings

Just like roles and rolebindings

kubectl get clusterroles

kubectl describe clusterrole clusterrole_name

kubectl get clusterrolebindings

kubectl describe clusterrolebindings clusterrolebinding_name

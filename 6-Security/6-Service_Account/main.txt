Humans use user accounts, apis and bots uses service accounts.

kubectl create serviceaccount name_of_account

kubectl get serviceaccounts


When you create a service account, it creates a token that the api will use to authenticate it.

If the bot is a pod in the secret generated can be mounted as volume for easy authentication.

There is always a default service account for each namespace. The apiserver can use this to query the pods

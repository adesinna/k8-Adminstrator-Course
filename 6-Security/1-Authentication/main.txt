This will show us how to secure our cluster.

Who can access the cluster like admins, developer and bots, and what they can do.

Admins, Developers and Bots(like API integrations)

Authentication Mechanism used by the kube API:
    It can be different ways such as

        Static Password File

        Static Token File

        Certificates

        Identity Services


1. Static Password File

    We can create a list of users in a csv file,
    this file with have 3 columns.
    password user userid (group)

    --basic-auth-file=list.csv  # this will be passed as an option in the kube-api config file
    # this will be passed as a command option in kube adm



2. Static Token File

    We can create a list of users in a csv file,
    this file with have 3 columns.
    token user userid (group)

    --token-auth-file=list-token.csv

So when you want to access the kube api server

curl -v -k https://master-node-ip/api/v1/pods -u "user1:password1"

This is not the best approach.

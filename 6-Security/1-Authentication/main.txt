This will show us how to secure our cluster.

Who can access the cluster, and what they can do.

Admins, Developers and Bots(like API integrations)

Authentication Mechanism:
    It can be different ways such as

        Static Password File

        Static Token File

        Certificates

        Identity Services


1. Static Password File

    We can create a list of users in a csv file,
    this file with have 3 columns.
    password user userid (group)

    --basic-auth-file=list.csv

2. Static Token File

    We can create a list of users in a csv file,
    this file with have 3 columns.
    token user userid (group)

    --token-auth-file=list.csv

So when you want to access the kube api server

curl -v -k https://master-node-ip/api/v1/pods -u "user1:password1"

This is not the best approach tho

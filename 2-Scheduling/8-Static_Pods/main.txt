Suppose a node is not attached to the master node, the yaml files should be  /etc/kubernetes/manifests
It will try to keep the pods alive till the file is removed. These pods are known as static
It is only pods you can create this way


It configured in the service of the kubelet # kubelet.service file

--pod-manifest-path=/etc/Kubernetes/manifest \\

or
--config=kubeconfig.yaml #
    in this file put
    staticPodPath: /etc/Kubernetes/manifest/kubeconfig.yaml

Any of the two methods would work

It now use docker ps to see the pods

Reason we use static pods, it can be use it to deploy the control plane on each nodes

kubectl get pods -A # all pods the node name is appended to it is called static pods

cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml # this is where you see the static pods path if it is not at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/

create a static pod in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/

To go to a node
kubectl get nodes node_name -o wide
    ssh internal_ip_of_node

kubectl run --restart=Never --image=busybox:1.28.4 static-busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > /etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-busybox.yam

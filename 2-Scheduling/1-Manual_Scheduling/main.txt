Every pod has a field called nodeName by default, which is not set, the scheduler identifies these pods and place them to
the appropriate nodes.

See 1-node_name.yaml as an example


Suppose the pod is created and there is no scheduler, the k8 will not allow you to use nodeName to assign pod to a node,
instead, you will create a binding object and send a post request the binding api in a json format

Every pod needs an amount of resources for it to run on the node.

Resources are the needed memory and cpus the pod needs, the limit is the maximum resources it can use on a node.

The scheduler looks for a node that have this resource available, the limit is the max it can consume.

The best is to just set request without using limits.

Limit range would affect all the pods in the namespace

apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: resource-limits
spec:
  limits:
  - type: Container
    default:
      memory: 512Mi
      cpu: 500m
    defaultRequest:
      memory: 256Mi
      cpu: 100m
    max:
      memory: 2Gi
      cpu: 2

You can always set limit on nodes too in the namespace

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: resource-quota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: 4Gi
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: 8Gi
    pods: "10"
